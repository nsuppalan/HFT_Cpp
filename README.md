Personal Project that implements a variety of HFT strategies in C++

This is still very much a work in progress. I hope to continue development into the future, adding more strategies, perhaps a dashboard of some kind, and importantly, the ability to trade via the FIX protocol.

Exchange: FTX.us

OS: Ubuntu Linux

Dependencies (Thus Far):
- Boost
- Poco
- Fix8

Resources Used:
- High-frequency trading in a limit order book (Marco Avellaneda & Sasha Stoikov) 
  - (https://people.orie.cornell.edu/sfs33/LimitOrderBook.pdf)
- Optimal High-Frequency Market Making (Takahiro Fushimi, Christian Gonz ÃÅalez Rojas, & Molly Herman)

Example of Pseudo-Market-Making (BCH/USD)... without actually trading... and if there was 0 latency... and takers for all my orders:
- This is using realtime data from FTX using a websocket, and conducting realtime analysis to determine profitable trades.
